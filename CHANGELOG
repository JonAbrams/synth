# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.0

- Added services + dependency injection. Useful for user-authentication and more!
- Added `synth routes` command, useful to see which API routes synth will auto-generate.
- Synth now no longer tries to parse functions preceded by an '_' character. Applies to both services and API request handlers.
- Show bower output while installing front-end packages. Thanks []
- ng-annotate used now instead of ng-min. Thanks [mikaelhm](https://github.com/mikaelhm)
- Added support for EJS out of the box. Thanks KoutarouYabe.
- Watches CoffeeScript files. Thanks KoutarouYabe.
- Forces latest version of package when conflict occurs while installing packages with bower.
- Special thanks to [mikaelhm](https://github.com/mikaelhm) for helping develop the idea behind services, and for updating the default project template + tests.

## 0.5.3

- Restore compatibility with Node v0.11.x. See [issue #53](https://github.com/JonAbrams/synth/issues/53)

## 0.5.2

- Set the listening port to the PORT env variable if the --port command-line flag is not set. If neither are set then use the default port 3000.

## 0.5.1

- [Added jade template error output.](https://github.com/JonAbrams/synth/issues/33)
